# Renaissance.Engineer — Principles

## A collaboratively curated directory

This is not a social network. It is not a place you sign up for. It is a curated, opinionated collection of people doing cross-disciplinary work worth paying attention to.

## Joined vs Added

There are two ways to appear in the directory:

- **Joined** — You found this place and added yourself. You are an active participant in the community.
- **Added** — Someone in the community nominated you because your work belongs here. You may not even know this directory exists yet.

Both are legitimate. The distinction is subtle and informational, not hierarchical. Being added is, if anything, a compliment — it means someone thought your work was worth highlighting.

## The directory as taste

The internet is vast and mostly noise. This directory is a small, curated window into the part of the web where people build seriously across disciplines. Every entry is a recommendation: "pay attention to this person."

Members can nominate others. The result is a collaboratively curated feed of the tasteful web — not algorithmic, not exhaustive, but intentional.

## What belongs here

People who have genuine depth in multiple disciplines and use the connections between them to build things. Not dabblers. Not people with a list of hobbies. People whose cross-disciplinary range is central to the quality of their work.
